My biggest problem with my Blog is my bad writing.
I am making to many mistakes, either typos or bad formatting.
This bothered my heavily and it is also something, which can be easily prevented (to some degree) by automation.

In this Blog Post i will shortly talk about:

- the tools i am using
- how to integrate the tools in GitHub Actions
- who inspired me

## Inspiration

I have to be honest here, i did not came across those tools by myself.
Within my current company we started writing a handbook and with a lot of editors, this became a mess over time.
One of the biggest problems have been spelling errors and inconsistent formatting of files.

Actually things which are easily to check by linters and a spellcheck.
Hence that we invested some time within the company and i decided to use the same tools, as i am already familiar with them.

## Tools

There are a lot of tools out there for this purpose.
There are even ready to use GitHub Actions, but i struggled with them.
I did not think they where as intuitive as the main tools by themselves.
Furthermore setting up GitHub Actions with Node.js and some packages is not really rocket since.

Additionally i have the benefit of even running them locally, so i can easier fix issues.

### Linting

I am using [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) for linting my Markdown files.

It has a really good documentation and also provides easy ways to ignore certain issues based on HTML comments, see [markdownlint configuration documentation](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#configuration).
Furthermore can i really easily configure rule definitions with a file within the repository.
I chose yaml therefore i have a `.markdownlint.yaml` file within my repository.

To lint all your markdown files within a directory run:

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli ./
```

### Spellcheck

There are a lot solutions for spellchecking out in the open.
I took a look at [PySpelling](https://facelessuser.github.io/pyspelling/) and other tools.
In the end i stuck to a Node.js approach by using [markdown-spellcheck](https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck).

A really nice and easy to use tool, which offers even an interactive mode for fixing issues locally.

```bash
npx markdown-spellcheck '**/*.md'
```

Important to note is, that you might want to use `-n` to ignore numbers and when used in a CI environment `-r` for just reporting.

## Automation with GitHub Actions

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
I will not go into details about GitHub Actions, i will just explain my two jobs.
If you are lacking basic GitHub Actions knowledge, please read the reference documentation.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

I implemented two jobs:

1. linting
2. spellchecking

Both of them rely on Node.js - so they are pretty similar in their configuration, and only diverge in the actual part of the execution.
I am using [Setup Node.js Environment](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-node-js-environment) Action from the marketplace to set up Node.js in the correct version.

```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: "15"
```

Furthermore both tools work with NPX so we do not even need to install anything upfront.

### Markdown-cli

As we have already setup Node.js for our next step the only thing missing is the execution.

```yaml
    - run: npx markdownlint-cli ./
```

As it might be hard to get an overview of all the changes, here you see the whole job.

```yaml
  lint:
    name: Linting
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: linting  
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: "15"
    - run: npx markdownlint-cli ./
```

### Markdown-spellcheck

Note worthy is the environment variable `FORCE_COLOR`.
It enables colorful output and allows for easier debugging of issues within GitHub Actions.

```yaml
    - env:
        FORCE_COLOR: 1
      run: npx markdown-spellcheck --en-us -n -r **/*.md
```

As it might be hard to get an overview of all the changes, here you see the whole job.

```yaml
  markdown-spellcheck:
    name: Spellchecking
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@master  
    - name: Spellchecking
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: "15"
    - env:
        FORCE_COLOR: 1
      run: npx markdown-spellcheck --en-us -n -r **/*.md *.md
```
