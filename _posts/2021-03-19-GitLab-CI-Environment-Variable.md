In our first post we learned how we can extract our build into an own centralized file.
Within this post we are focusing on configuration via environment variables.

This is a post of a series on our approaches.

## Defining Environment Variables

The environment variables offer a good solution to define external changes.
There are two was to define them, both use the same `variables` directive, but one allows us to define a description which will be shown in the UI when manually triggering the pipeline.

    ```yaml
    variables:
        # without description
        VARIABLE_A: "value"
        # with a description
        VARIABLE_B:
            value: "value"
            description: "description"
    ```

## Using Environment Variables

Environment variables can be called by their name in a bash like manner - `$VARIABLE_NAME`.

We will be using our `tools.gitlab-ci.yml` and our `.gitlab-ci.yml` from our first blog post for this examples.

    ```yaml
    # tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    job:
        stage: build
        image: alpine:latest
        before_script:
            - echo "some tool specific setup"
        script:
            - echo "default action"
    ```

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

For the beginning we want to just replace our echo with a variable, let's call it `ECHO`.

    ```yaml
    # tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    job:
        stage: build
        image: alpine:latest
        before_script:
            - echo "some tool specific setup"
        script:
            - echo "$ECHO"
    ```

## Defining Environment variables

There are multiple ways how we can define the environment variables, each of them has their pros and cons.
I will try to shed some light and also reveal some of the thought processes behind it.

### within .gitlab-ci.yml

I would not recommend to go this way, as the user needs to have deeper knowledge of the `jobs.gitlab-ci.yml`.
At least not fully, in later examples i will show you, how you can leverage this functionality together with the `jobs.gitlab-ci.yml`

Defining it within `.gitlab-ci.yml` can be achieved in two ways.
Either we define it globally like

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO: "our echo"

    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

... or we define it on the job like

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml

    job:
        variables:
            ECHO: "our echo"
    ```

### within tools.gitlab-ci.yml

When you extracted functionality into an own `.gitlab-ci.yml`-file, i recommend to provide either a good documentation about the options or make the extracted file as self explanatory as possible.
A simple way to achieve this, is using the value and description definition for environment variables.

This might spoil the overview of your pipeline, but there are ways to bypass this, which i will show you later.

Defining it is similar to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    # tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO: 
            value: "default echo"
            description: "this will be printed by the job"

    job:
        stage: build
        image: alpine:latest
        before_script:
            - echo "some tool specific setup"
        script:
            - echo "$ECHO"
    ```

#### Overwriting

You also maybe want to overwrite those variables.
There are a few ways we can overwrite it:

- Copy/Paste/Replace
- Overwrite and Hide

##### Copy/Paste/Replace

Therefore we can even combine the two ways of defining them within the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, and provide a better readable and described variable for our run dialog.

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO: 
            value: "our echo"
            description: "this will be printed by the job now as we overwrite it"

    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

![Run Pipeline](/assets/2021-03-19/run-pipeline-overwriting-echo.png)

This will still show this information on the `run pipeline`-form.

##### Overwrite and Hide

The first approach showed us, how we can copy, paste and replace this information.
Maybe we want to not "spoil" our form, as we do not need to manipulate it anyways.

If not we are provided with simple tools and replace the definition with the first version.

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO: "our echo"

    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

![Run Pipeline](/assets/2021-03-19/run-pipeline-hiding-and-overwriting-echo.png)

## Hiding extracted environment variables

Sometimes we are fine with the default values and do not want to show any information about this variable within the `run pipeline`-form.

For smaller includes this can be easy, as the number of environment variables is small.

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO:
            description: ""

    include:
        - local: tools.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

But it again forces the user to have prior knowledge of his include, or if the include changes to also maintain his own build.

### with an own file

As we were facing this regularly we came up with a small hack.
For each of our includes, we provide a second include, with the sole purpose of hiding the variables.
Besides the effect of hiding the variables, we are also able to provide additional information of the basic include to the user.

You might be wondering how we name this file and what the content is.
We named it `tools.hide.gitlab-ci.yml` and it just copies the environment variables of `tools.gitlab-ci.yml` but replaces the description.

    ```yaml
    # tools.hide.gitlab-ci.yml
    variables:
        ECHO:
            description: ""
    ```

The include within the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is working the same way.
Now somebody can actively turn the description on and off if needed.

    ```yaml
    # .gitlab-ci.yml
    include:
        - local: 
            - tools.gitlab-ci.yml
            - tools.hide.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

## Conclusion

It is easy to provide some kind of configuration to the user.
It is also fairly easy to document them and make it visible within the pipeline.
Also with our hack it is easy to hide them, if they are not needed.

## Word of Advice

Those are highly opinionated solutions, which are covering our use cases.
They might not be the ideal fit for your solution.
But I hope they offer inspiration.
